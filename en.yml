        As an advisor I worked with different companies (of various sizes and maturity) to help them gain skills needed for transforming their culture, technology stack, architecture, processes and systems while introducing innovative technologies to the existing systems.
        I mentored teams, leads and architects on how to build scalable, extensible architectures while integrating them with legacy systems. My work involved conducting technical due diligence, technical debt assessments, workshops and trainings.
